# esp32jukebox
ESP32 + Serial MP3 module, just messing around

Requires dfplayer-mp: https://github.com/Muhlex/dfplayer-mp

Playing folder numbers doesn't seem to work, so I pass "None" and all seems OK.

There's a button listener to go to the next track.
The LEDs light up according to track number (I wanted to do a query based on the filename but so far that eludes me!
